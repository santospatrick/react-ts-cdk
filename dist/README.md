> 🔥 React + Typescript Boilerplate to develop your own react components and reuse in another projects

![React Typescript Component Development Kit](images/intro.jpg)

## Motivation

Components are cool! We should use them everywhere. So, you expent time developing a lot of components and now you want to reuse them in another awesome project & all your projects need your components updated when a new feature is released (and you also need typechecking, tests, hot module replacement & all the good stuff).

## Directory Structure

```
.
├── src
|   └── components
|       └── MyComponent                 # Your component
|           ├── MyComponent.story.tsx   # Storybook of your component
|           ├── MyComponent.test.tsx    # Jest + Enzyme tests
|           ├── MyComponent.tsx         # Its JSX + Typescript file
|           └── types.ts                # Types for props
|       └── MyComponentX                # Another component X
|       └── MyComponentY                # Another component Y
|       └── MyComponentZ                # Another component Z
|       └── stories.tsx                 # Storybook config file
├── dist
|    └── index.js                       # Exporting all Componentss
```

## Usage

1. Fork it!
2. install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

3. Create your account in TravisCI & Code Coverage
4. Configure TravisCI environment variables `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN` & `NPM_TOKEN` with right permissions (you can find in their websites) for repo access to release new versions & intercept in pull requests
5. Make sure you have these options checked in TravisCI:

6. Follow [contributing](#contributing)
7. in your project, run the following:

```
yarn add https://github.com/yourusername/react-ts-cdk
```

8. import your components developed in this repo & use them!

## Features

* [x] React
* [x] Typescript
* [x] Storybook
* [x] Jest
* [x] Enzyme

## Workflow

[See presentation](http://slides.com/santospatrick/react-typescript-cdk/fullscreen)

![Repository Workflow](images/workflow.png)

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Maybe use storybook to test your component in its final UI version: `yarn run storybook`
4. If using storybook, then open `localhost:6006` to get a hot module replacement environment to visualize your component after every file saved
5. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
6. Check our [workflow](#workflow) (it will help you understand how you should develop your feature), if you haven't yet.
7. Commit your changes: `yarn run commit`
8. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
9. Submit a pull request :smile:
